        <h2>Get the perfect white rice every time!</h2>
            <p>It is possible to make perfectly fluffy white rice on the stovetop. Sauteing the rice first helps keep the rice grains separate.</p>
            <p>Keeping the pot covered for the entire cooking time traps the steam which is necessary for properly cooking the rice, and is very important. 
                The last 5 minutes off the heat allow the rice to finish in the residual steam, without burning the bottom.</p>
