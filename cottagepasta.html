        <h2>Wow! It's pasta with cottage cheese</h2>
            <p>This recipe is great for nights when you get home and need something to wind down.</p>
            <p>'Turos Csusza' is a Hungarian dish I learned from my Dad last year when I turned twelve. 
                It consists of bacon, egg noodles, sour cream, and cottage cheese. 'Elvezet!'</p>
